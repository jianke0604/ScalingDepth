Depth is a scaling axis, but only if your residual connections let it be.
ScalingDepth collects residual connection designs, from ResNet's identity shortcut to
Hyper-Connections and Attention Residuals, along with the benchmarks and analysis of whether extra layers
become extra computation.

## What's inside

| Page | Content |
|---|---|
| **Residuals** | Searchable collection of 45+ residual, normalization and depth-parametrization designs in 5 families, each with a one-line update rule |
| **Benchmarks** | Controlled evaluations of whether added depth becomes computation (e.g. DepthBench) |
| **Papers** | Reading list of analysis, theory and systems papers on effective depth |
| **Community** | How to contribute, roadmap, maintainers |

### Families

- **Classic Shortcuts**: Highway, ResNet, Stochastic Depth, DenseNet
- **Normalization Placement**: Post-LN, Pre-LN, Sandwich-LN, ResiDual, Mix-LN, Peri-LN, HybridNorm, DyT, LNS, nGPT, KEEL, GeoNorm, SiameseNorm, KiteNorm
- **Residual Scaling & Parametrization**: Fixup, ReZero, SkipInit, Admin, LayerScale, DeepNorm, Depth-µP, 1/√L scaling, CompleteP
- **Cross-Layer Aggregation**: RealFormer, DenseFormer, Value Residual, RWKV-7 Value Residual, LAuReL, DCA, MUDDFormer, AttnRes (Full / Block / variants), MoDA
- **Multi-Stream / Hyper-Connections**: HC, mHC, TBP-mHC, xHC, oHC
